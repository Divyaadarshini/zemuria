Q1: Grid Layout
Create a 3 column grid with 360px height and 32px padding and make it responsive such that 
itâ€™s a 2 column grid with 250px height and 12px padding.

The responsive grid layout was achieved through the use of CSS Grid and media queries. Initially, the layout is configured to display three columns with a height of 360px and padding of 32px. To ensure adaptability across various devices, media queries are employed to adjust the grid's properties for smaller screens with a height of 250px and padding of 12px.
